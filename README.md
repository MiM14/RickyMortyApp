# Rick and Morty App

This is a mobile application that allows users to browse information about the popular TV show, Rick and Morty. The app uses the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to fetch data about characters, locations, and episodes.

## Architecture
The app was developed using the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern, which separates the UI from the business logic and data access layers. This makes the app easier to maintain, test, and evolve over time.

Additionally, the app was built using Clean Architecture principles, which prioritize the separation of concerns and the use of abstractions to minimize dependencies between layers. This approach allows for greater flexibility and scalability as the app grows and evolves.

## Features

- Characters list : users can view a list of characters from the show, along with their image and name
- View character details: users can tap on a character to view more information, including their name, gender, status, and species.
